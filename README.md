# DISCLAIMER
This project is only for fun, don't use for illegal activities!
Play some tunes and enjoy!

# PayPlayer
Toy project designed after a payment service, but for playing some simple melodies

## Design
I designed it to be similar to the Swedish payment system Swish.
After sending money to a receiver you get the chance to play some fun little tunes on the verification screen. So I tried to mimic it so that you can practice some tunes without sending money.
End product will not be as similar to the Swish app. I don't want it to be used in scams.
